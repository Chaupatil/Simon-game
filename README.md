Simon Game
A web-based implementation of the classic Simon game where players must repeat a sequence of colors shown by the game. Each round, the sequence grows longer, and the player must remember and reproduce it correctly to advance to the next level. The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each correctly repeated sequence.
